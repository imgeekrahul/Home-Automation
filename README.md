# Home-Automation
Voice control Home Automation over Google Assistant using NodeMCU micro controller board, Relay Board, jumpher wires, and home based things such as bulb, wire, holder etc. This is a small project only for demostration purpose, you may include in your room cum lab, all over your entire house.
Some useful tools are as follows:
> Arduino IDE
> NodeMCU
> Relay Board
> jumpher wire
> Some home based machanism(Bulb, holder, wire, etc.)

I should also post the SS(ScreenShots) that how you can connect and make your live Home Automation project.

Feel free to ask any question at any time. I'll absolutely respond to you on the same day at any time at any cost.
